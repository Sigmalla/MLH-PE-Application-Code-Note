MLH PE Fellowship: Code sample context &amp; project from upcoming MLH Global Hack Week: GenAI.

Subject: Code Sample Context for MLH Production Engineering Fellowship Application

Dear MLH Fellowship Admissions Team,

Thank you for the opportunity to apply for the Production Engineering Fellowship.

Regarding the code sample requirement, I want to provide context. While I have worked on projects involving HTML, CSS, and foundational JavaScript, I understand and share your preference for a sample demonstrating more substantial, self-driven logic that solves a real problem and is truly representative of my current abilities.

To best meet this, and to provide a strong representation of my skills, particularly in languages aligned with the fellowship tracks (such as Python or JavaScript), I am making dedicated preparations for MLH's upcoming **Global Hack Week: GenAI, scheduled from June 13-19, 2025.** Demonstrating my commitment to this opportunity and to developing a high-quality project, I have already requested and secured annual leave from my current employment for this entire period to ensure I can fully immerse myself in the event.

I am committed to using this focused time to build a robust and relevant project, which I would be very pleased to share with you as my primary code sample immediately upon its completion. I am confident it will offer a much clearer demonstration of my skills and potential for the Production Engineering Fellowship.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration. I am very enthusiastic about the possibility of joining the MLH Fellowship.

Sincerely,
Kristine Kuprevica.
